A user by the name evgnb then appeared on Acheron's "New HFSLIP 1.7.10 beta K v9 build 20150818" thread on MSFN.org which had for the most part
died-downed and started posting his continuation of Acheron's code to which he also added code from HFSLIP2000.

                 Debug release.
* 2020 Aug. 19 - Version: 1.7.11e-debug
                 Merged code from branch 1.0.2 of HFSLIP2000 project (dated 2016) to hfslip-1.7.10_beta_K_v9/1.7.11a-debug (dated 2015/2020) and
                 new version 1.7.11e-debug now integrates XP/2003 updates to Windows 2000 without problem:
                 + HFSLIP2000 - 2015.08.16 1.0.1 - Rename language specific DLL to xpsp3res.dll when slipstreaming non-English Windows XP
                                updates into Windows 2000. Slipstream TTC fonts. Fix deleting REG.EXE log files in 2000/XP/2003 when adding
                                48-bit LBA support. Check for 7ZA.EXE requirements. Cosmetic fixes.
                 + HFSLIP2000 - 2016.11.19 1.0.2 - Slipstream Type 2 updates silently (changed the /Q switch to /Q:A). Cosmetic fixes (removed
                                trailing spaces in the script).
                 Very strange bug fixed - now disable autoconvert long file names to short file names (maybe it's Windows 7 cmd.exe bug).
                 Merged code from branch 1.0.2 of HFSLIP2000 project - cleanup some *.TMP after Windows install.
                 Debug release.
                 
                 Version: 1.7.11f-debug
                 Bugfix broken HFSLIPWU.inf DX9C - HFSLIPDY (all OS).
* 2020 Aug. 22 - Version: 1.7.11n-debug
                 Downgrade RegisterDlls section and replace it to CMD-file call for Windows 2000 compatibility.
* 2020 Aug. 27 - Version: 1.7.11q-debug
                 Replace CMDHIDE.EXE, etc. with simple VBScript code that run batch files with its window hide. No 3rd-party *.exe files needed now.
                 Less black windows flickers while setup.
                 [SetupHotfixesToRun] lines in SVCPACK.inf runs from CD [not drive C:], directory is cd_drive:\I386\SVCPACK;
                 CatalogSubDir="i386\SVCPACK" line from SVCPACK.INF.
                 CreateProcessW adds to left part every line string "...i386\SVCPACK\" and you may run programs in that directory only.
                 This is hack for ugly CreateProcessW in svcpack.dll, that run every lines in SVCPACK.inf::SetupHotfixesToRun section.
                 Solution: you need copy wscript.exe to I386\SVCPACK to use VBScript in SetupHotfixesToRun.
* 2020 Aug. 28 - Version: 1.7.11s-debug
                 Refactoring :MAKEISO subroutine.
                 Version: 1.7.11t-debug

                 Add Driver Signing patch (to delete *.cat files after SFC/WFP DRM patch) - setupapi.dll and PatchPAE3 Version: 0.0.0.48 beta-6+
                 needed.
                 Add PAE patch (ntkrnlpa.exe and ntkrpamp.exe).


Now I, ultra_code, am throwing my hat into the ring. I have been disappointed by the fact that evgnb's code did not just work out of the box (or
even at all despite my best efforts) for Windows 2000. I also had issues with Acheron's 1.7.10K v9. I think the issues stemmed from Acheron
trying to change from HKLM registry entries to simplier entries as noted by his 2014/02/27 changelog update (although I do not have that build
to test).

So, for HFSLIP v1.8, I made a *lot* of changes to *everything*, including this changelog file. I'm hoping these changes will improve the situation
a bit and make it easier for newer devs to have a look at the code.


<HFSLIP 1.8 changelog by ultra_code>
* 2024 Aug. 27 - (BETA)
                 Significantly reformatted, refactored, reorganized, and made the prior code more "strict" in terms of evaluation. Reverted (but
                 commented-out) a lot of changes/additions made by evgnb in favor of implementations in pre-problematic 1.7.10 (e.g. HFSLIP2000).
                 "Local" variables are now deleted once used. A lot of GOTO statements (the majority added by evgnb) have been replaced with IF
                 statements. Some flexibility in the code has been removed (e.g. the script now *requires* 7za.exe to work; 7za.exe has been
                 included with HFSLIP for a long time). Some bugs I found when looking through the code have been squashed (e.g. WMSLIP addding
                 configuation information when you weren't slipstreaming WMP into W2K). The patches introduced by evgnb (SFC/WFP, Driver Cert.,
                 PAE, and Retail-to-OEM) have been made toggleable via HFANSWER.ini. Added a lot of TODO statements to be looked-at by someone
                 else at a later date. Included in a new DOC directory documentation I manually compiled for HFSLIP v1.8 including the execution
                 breakdown in main, function breakdowns/layouts, and breakouts of HFSLIP-generated CMD files for easier viewing. Also editted
                 Defrag.cmd written by Mim0.
* 2024 Sep. 20 - (BETA)
                 Corrected variables references made inside of an IF statement whose condition is if that said variable is DEFINED. Variables that
                 are being checked if they exist will be DelayedExpansion'd in the IF code block in addition to follow-up chained IF conditions.
                 Also fixed some additional inconsistencies with my formatting I found in the process, as well as a regression I caused where
                 HFSLIP.log isn't copied to the ISO.
* 2024 Sep. 23 - (BETA)
                 Fixed a syntax error with an IF statement that crashed the script in function HF1COMMON_A.
* 2024 Sep. 25 - (BETA)
                 Updated some comments in the script. Sharing this with the world proper now.
* 2025 Aug. 03 - (Release)
                 Cleaned-up some documentation text inside of the script, changed the searched-for location of HFANSWER.ini to the base directory,
                 made sure everything in the HFTOOLS directory was up-to-date, and uploaded the main parts of the program and the contents of
                 HFTOOLS separetely to GitHub.
